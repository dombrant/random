# Random

A CLI to generate a random number. Written in Node.js.

## Usage

`$ random <max min>`

Clone the repo and run `npm link`. Then call `random` from the command line inside of any directory. The default `max` and `min` values are 0 and 10 (this means the number can be equal to 10, equal to 0, or any number in between).

To generate a random number between x and 0, call `random x`.

To generate a random number between x and y, call `random x y`.
